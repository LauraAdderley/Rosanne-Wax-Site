__Free African Villages--New Providence, Bahamas__ is a preliminary experimental site to begin a process of making widely available the life stories of almost 300,000 survivors of the Atlantic slave trade who gained their legal freedom because of colonial and national bans on international slave trading between 1800 and 1870.  [LiberatedAfricans.org](https://liberatedafricans.org/) is a larger project directed by historian Henry Lovejoy. Within the Caribbean, the largest settlements of these people--termed African *recaptives*, emancipados or *liberated Africans*--occurred in the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad and British Guiana, but also in Antigua, Tortola and Grenada in smaller numbers.  Because of a growing British bureaucratic state and abolitionist agitation of the era rare data exists about their everyday lives.  In several notable cases, semi-independent settlements were created for them. This site showcases two of these settlements--**Adelaide** and **Carmichael** located on the southwestern part of the island of New Providence.  

The population in these two small villages in the Bahamas were a very small part of that much larger group of Africans taken from illegally operating Atlantic slave ships.  Much information about overall scale of this population and its relation to larger slave trade history can be found on the [Transatlantic Slave Trade Database](https://slavevoyages.org/)
